Houses with 4 rooms are more preferred by the buyers than houses with 5 or 6 rooms.

The main areas of Chennai, such as T Nagar, Anna Nagar, KK Nagar, and Velachery, have higher sales value due to the availability of shops, malls, theatres, hospitals, and schools.

Houses with good street have higher sales value.

The distance from the main road does not directly affect the sales price of the houses.

The age of the house does not have a significant impact on the sales price of the house.

## Recommendations:
Based on the findings, the following recommendations are suggested for the real estate agencies to make more profits:

Build commercial or residential buildings in the main areas of Chennai, such as Velachery, T Nagar, Anna Nagar, and KK Nagar, to increase the sales value of the properties.

Build houses with good streets and parking facilities to meet the buyers' preferences and increase the sales value.

Increase the number of rooms and square feet of the house to increase the sales value.
